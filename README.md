I can build Sniperbot to quickly trade any tokens on #UniswapV2 Router. I can build the bot with the following features,

1. Buy/Sell (Manual)

2. Buy/Sell (Limit Orders)

3. Liquidity Snipe - Tracking a Token and quickly executes a buy trade when Liquidity is added

4. Method Snipe - Sniping a token when a particular method is called by the token owner.

5. Slippage Adjustment

6. PnL Analysis Image Gen - Generates an Image with the PnL stats once the token is sold.

7. Trading View Chart Integration

6. Whale Tx Detection - If enabled, alerts users on whale wallet transactions

In addition to this, I can also build the following bots,

1. #FreshwalletDetector - When a specific token is randomly bought from fresh wallets with no past transactions in certain blocks, it sends the token information to a TG channel

2. #SnipeDetector - When a freshly launched token with less than 100 Transfers is bought simultaneously from different wallets within a certain number of blocks, then it is notified in the channel.

3. #ProfitNLoss Analysis - By providing the Token Address and the Wallet Address, the bot will generate an Image consisting of the profit and loss stats of the wallet for the specified tokens based on the Trade history.

I can work on any custom bot ideas as well.
